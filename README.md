# fileSyncr

WIP app that allows working on multiple text files from multiple computers at the same time.

### Still left to do (not necessarily in this order):

* replace the Java serializer with something more efficient. Getting warning:
```Using the default Java serializer for class [actors.Messages$EventDataMessage$DiffEventMsg] which is not recommended because of performance implications. Use another serializer or disable this warning using the setting 'akka.actor.warn-about-java-serializer-usage'```

* create some simple ui (cli) and test:<br>
 1.locally <br>
 2.one local and one remote <br>

* create some real ui (Vaadin maybe? JavaFX?)

* move to ssl

* add some authentication method
